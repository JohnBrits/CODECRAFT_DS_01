 Age and Gender Classification of Salary Dataset  

This project involves analyzing a salary dataset to classify individuals based on age and gender. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the gender and age group of a person based on various features in the salary dataset.
Possible Objectives
Classification Tasks:

Age Classification: Categorizing individuals into age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, etc.).

Gender Classification: Predicting gender based on salary and other demographic factors.

Feature Engineering:

Identifying key features such as salary, occupation, experience, education level, industry, etc.

Creating derived features that may enhance classification accuracy.

Data Processing:

Handling missing values and outliers.

Encoding categorical variables (such as job roles, education levels).

Model Selection:

Experimenting with classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, or Deep Learning models.

Comparing model performances using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights & Business Use Cases:

Understanding gender pay gaps.

Identifying salary trends based on age and gender.

Assisting HR analytics in fair salary distribution.
